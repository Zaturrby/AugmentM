	<h1> EVALUATION</h1>
	<p>We prototyped and tested three features, which tried to provide answers to the human-centered design question: “How we might engage museum visitors more with their surrounding without indicating a distinction by putting value into the aspect they choose to engage with?”

	Even stronger, by letting them emphasizing their own aspects in order to find their own approach to the exhibition.

	The ambition was to take away their feeling of 'social awkwardness' or felt lack of knowledge through letting them contribute their own impressions and observations about the museum and the artworks in it, and through encountering random stories or trivia questions at at random pieces of art by other visitors.

	The critical feedback we received matched our hypothesis that visitors of the 'cultural professional'-group, who already know how they can personally interact with the museum setting, required and appreciated the informal quality of the stories less than visitors of the other categories.

	<p>Visitors largely appreciated the possibility of submitting own stories and trivia questions, and were tempted to do so.

	The majority of the test persons indicated that they would use the app throughout the museum if it was available, that they would recommend it to their friends or family and like the idea to contribute to the app content themselves. In that regard, the first prototyped versions of design features are ready to develop further and to be tested with extended functionality.

	On general terms, the human-centered design approach in combination with creative and visual research methods has proven to

	be incredibly fruitful when researching the different aspects that visitors deal with when visiting the Rijksmuseum. And to carefully compare those to the assumptions made by museum professional (including ourselves).

	To take museum visitors serious in their needs and different levels of cultural capital, allowed us to socially augment the masterpieces of</p>
