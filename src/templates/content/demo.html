	<h1>Doesn't matter how much 'cultural capital' you bring.</h1>
	<h3>Features for visitor's engagement</h3>
	<p>The visitor's experience of the Rijksmuseum and the interaction of visitors with artworks are necessarily embedded in a strong social framework. As the museum adheres to a large number of social rules it is often thought of as a rather intimidating place, than a place for learning and curiosity and as a visitor, one cannot get anywhere close to knowing everything about the collection.

	The vast amount of knowledge that is bundled in and around the museum often reminds visitors of their insufficient knowledge, which therefore lets them feel slightly awkward when walking through the exhibition.

	Rather than trying to attempt to engage people with in-depth (art) historical background information about art works, we set up three ways of social interaction on a broader range with the museum and the other visitors.

	Through engaging on more general terms with the surrounding, people will be more likely to find their own access to the museum and ultimately to the artworks in it.

	Visitors can contribute and share their observations and knowledge, no matter what their 'cultural capital' is, which creates a feeling of being valuable.</a>
