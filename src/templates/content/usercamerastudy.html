	<blockquote>For the User Video Study, I asked children to wear a camera during their museum visit as their perspective is not only physically different, but their view and span of attention is less trained yet compared to adults.</blockquote>

	<h2>...and how to get rid of them.</h2>
	<h3>Visual Feedback Methods</h3>
	<p>I use Visual User Feedback methods to understand different perspectives and gain insights from the museum visitors. Those methods not only give room to individual oral feedback, but also to visual stories and experiences. Therefore the oral and visual feedback from the user, reveals different kinds of information than a thematically focused survey.<br> 
	The Photographic User Camera Study consists of two phases. First, the participants are given a camera with which they walk through the museum and take pictures of anything drawing their attention. They can choose themselves what they capture, for how long they want to stay in the exhibition and how many pictures they take.<br>
	The collecting phase is followed by a qualitative interview in which the participant first gets to talk about the photographs in a way that is comparable to someone showing their vacation pictures: descriptive and as detailed as they prefer. Later on specific questions concerning sensual experiences (what did you hear, smell, touch?) and digital devices (which devices did you use during your visit and to do what?) are asked.</p>
