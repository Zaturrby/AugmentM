	<h2>Social augmentation vs. technological masterpieces?</h2>
	<h3>Project objectives</h3>
	<p>'Augmentation' is currently often brought up in relation to 'augmented reality' which uses a virtual layer over what we conceive as our real life. Often the use of the word goes hand in hand with a supposed technological innovation, and also our project title suggests that a superimposed “computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view”1 will be in the centre of attention.<br> 
	However, the research at stake is not implying an augmented reality but much rather the process of augmentation of artworks in the Rijksmuseum by means of technology.<br> 
	When the literal meaning of 'augmentation' simply describes it as 'make something greater by adding to it', 'to increase' or the 'act of making greater'2, the questions arise of (a) what aspects of the artworks should be highlighted, (b) for whom, (c) how does the interface between the object and the viewer look like and (d) through which digital device and software will the work of art be enhanced? </p>

	<h1>Interdisciplinary approach</h1>
	<p>In order to tackle the first two questions, the design thinking method was used for structuring the whole process of the project, substituted by Visual Feedback Methods which are partly taken from the design thinking toolbox3 and partly developed in my artistic research practice throughout the past years.<br> 
	Embedded research projects stimulate collaborations between cultural institutions, the creative industries and universities.<br> 
	In order to do justice to not only theoretically investigate, but also practically implement research results within the same project, this new form of research within the humanities, also needs a revised set of tools and possible forms for output.<br> 
	The methodological combination of the above mentioned toolboxes from design thinking and artistic research, guaranteed an adequate interdisciplinary assemblage of techniques and media. Whereas Artistic Research allows to creatively and practically work with post-modern theories, the Design Thinking approach gives access to co-creation frameworks and user innovation while building a product-oriented bridge between academic research, creative output and technological prototype.</p>
